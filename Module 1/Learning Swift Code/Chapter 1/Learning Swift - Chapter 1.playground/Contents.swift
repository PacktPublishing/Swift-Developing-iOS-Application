var str = "Hello, playground"

/*
   This is a multi-line comment
   that takes up more than one line
   of code
*/

//: If you uncomment the following code, it will produce an error because
//: a vairable named str has already been defined above

//var str = "Something Else" // Invalid redeclaration of 'str'

//: It is fine to create a new variable with a different name
var strTwo = "Something Else"
